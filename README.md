Rust bindings to the [MapVina Native](https://mapvina.com/projects/native/) map rendering engine.

## Usage

We use `mapvina-native`s' "core library", a static, pre-compiled library.
We also allow you to compile this yourself.
Instructions for this are below.

### Backend Features

This crate supports multiple rendering backends:

- `vulkan` (default on Linux/Windows): `cargo build --features vulkan`
- `opengl` (cross-platform): `cargo build --features opengl`
- `metal` (default on macOS/iOS): `cargo build --features metal`

If no feature is specified, the crate will automatically select the platform-appropriate default backend.

We also support the following other features:

- `pool` A tile rendering pool for building tile servers. See [`SingeThreadedRenderingPool`]() for further details
- `log` logging via the [`log` library](https://lib.rs/log)

At its core, we work as follows:

```rust
use mapvina_native::{ImageRendererBuilder, Image};
use std::num::NonZeroU32;

let mut renderer = ImageRendererBuilder::new()
                      .with_size(NonZeroU32::new(512).unwrap(),NonZeroU32::new(512).unwrap())
                      .build_static_renderer();
renderer.load_style_from_url(&"https://maps.mapvina.com/styles/v1/streets.json?key=public_key".parse().unwrap());
let image: Image = renderer.render_static(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0).unwrap();

// Access the underlying ImageBuffer for all operations
let img_buffer = image.as_image();
println!("Image dimensions: {}x{}", img_buffer.width(), img_buffer.height());
img_buffer.save("map.png").unwrap();
```

> ***TIP:*** Next to the static rendering map mode, we also have continous and a tile based one.
> Continous is desiged to be interactive, while the tile based one is primarily for tile servers

### Platform Support

The following platform and rendering-API combinations are supported and tested in CI:

| Platform    | Metal | Vulkan | OpenGL |
|-------------|-------|--------|--------|
| Linux x86   | ❌    | ✅     | ✅     |
| Linux ARM   | ❌    | ✅     | ✅     |
| Windows x86 | ❌    | 🟨     | 🟨     |
| Windows ARM | ❌    | 🟨     | 🟨     |
| macOS ARM   | ✅    | ✅[^1] | ❌     |

<sub>
✅ = IS supported and tested in CI
🟨 = SHOULD be supported, but currently is not
❌ = Not possible
</sub>

[^1]: Vulkan support on macos is provided via `MoltenVK`. There is a slight performance overhead for this with little upsides. Both Metal and Vulkan run through the same extensive test suite upstream. You can use Vulkan if you find a bug in the Metal implementation until we have fixed it upstream.

### Dependencies

This command will install the required dependencies on Linux or macOS for the `vulkan` backend.
You may also use it with `opengl` parameter on Linux.
It is OK to run this command multiple times for each backend.

```shell
just install-dependencies vulkan
```

### Getting the core library

Since we wrap the [Mapvina native library](https://mapvina.com/projects/native/), we need this and its headers to be included.

By default the library will be downloaded and build locally during the build process of mapvina-native-rs.

We can get the library and headers from two places:
- <details>
  <summary>default: library will be downloaded and build locally during the build process of mapvina-native-rs</summary>
  The specific version is controllable from the `build.rs` file.
  </details>
- <details>
  <summary>downloaded from the releases page</summary>

  The specific version of [MapVina Native](https://mapvina.com/projects/native/) used is controlled by `package.metadata.mln.release` in `Cargo.toml`.
  This dependency is automatically updated via a GitHub workflow on the 1st of each month repository.
  A pull request is created if an update is available.

  </details>
- <details>
  <summary>if the env vars <code>MLN_PRECOMPILE</code><code>MLN_CORE_LIBRARY_PATH</code> and <code>MLN_CORE_HEADERS_PATH</code> are set: from local disk via the environment variables</summary>

  If you don't want to allow network access during buildscript execution, we allow you to download the release and tell us where you have downloaded the contents.
  You can also build from source by following the steps that mapvina-native does in CI to produce the artefacts.

  </details>

## Development

- This project is easier to develop with [just](https://github.com/casey/just#readme), a modern alternative to `make`.
  Install it with `cargo install just`.
- To get a list of available commands, run `just`.
- To run tests, use `just test`.
